1. Build was failing. Needed to Add below entries in build.gradle to make it stable
  compileOnly("org.projectlombok:lombok")
  testCompile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test")

  springBoot {
    mainClass = "com.db.awmd.challenge.DevChallengeApplication"
  }

2. Added one TODO in AccountsService.moneyTransfer()
As a better practice, enhancement mentioned in TODO needs to be handled in getAccount method only.

3. We can implement annotation based validation on input params.
e.g. Whether fromAccountId, toAccountId are valid or not. Balance provided is valid or not. We can use annotation for that.

4. Exception handling could be enhanced. We can use @@ControllerAdvice.

5. Logging could be improved. It would help in production support.

6. Multithreading is implemented considering current in memory storage of accounts hashmap. In case of actual @JpaRepository, implementation may need to change.

Assumption - While solving this coding assignment, I assumed that i have to take care of only said functionality (balance transfer between given accounts)
